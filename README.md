# Modified AMSI Bypass

This repository contains a modified AMSI bypass script with added comments to better describe what is going on. 

The main intention behind the modification of RastaMouse's script was to get a better handle on how it works in order to build better bypasses for AV evasion. 


# Usage
```
PS > .\AmsiBypass.ps1
PS > Invoke-Bypass
```

# Credits 
All credit goes to **RastaMouse** for the original script.
